## Introduction

This project implements a face recognition system designed to automate student attendance tracking. Leveraging state-of-the-art computer vision techniques, this system identifies and verifies student identities by capturing and analyzing facial features in real time. This method significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of attendance tracking processes in educational environments, minimizing manual errors and ensuring a seamless experience for both students and educators.

## Project Overview

The face recognition system is composed of several key components that work together to deliver a fully functional and user-friendly attendance tracking solution. The primary components include:

- **Image Processing**: Captures and processes images from a webcam, identifying facial landmarks and features for further analysis.
- **Face Recognition**: Uses pre-computed face encodings to match detected faces with known student records.
- **Firebase Integration**: Utilizes Firebase Realtime Database and Cloud Storage to store and retrieve student data and attendance records.
- **User Interface**: Provides a dynamic visual interface that displays student information and system status in real time.

The system operates by continuously capturing video frames from a webcam, detecting faces within each frame, and comparing these faces to a set of known student encodings. When a match is found, the student's attendance is updated in the database, and relevant information is displayed on the screen.

## Technology Stack

This project employs a combination of modern technologies to deliver an efficient and scalable solution:

- **OpenCV**: An open-source computer vision library that enables image and video processing capabilities. It is used for capturing video frames, manipulating images, and rendering graphics.

- **face_recognition**: A powerful library built on top of dlib, which provides robust facial recognition and face manipulation functionality. It is responsible for detecting faces in images and comparing facial features to known encodings.

- **Firebase**: A comprehensive platform for building web and mobile applications, providing tools for database management, authentication, and hosting. This project utilizes Firebase Realtime Database to store student attendance records and Firebase Cloud Storage to manage student images.

- **cvzone**: A computer vision library that simplifies the creation of complex image processing tasks and user interfaces. It is used to overlay text and graphical elements on the video stream, enhancing the user experience.

- **NumPy**: A fundamental library for numerical computing in Python, providing support for array operations and mathematical functions. It is used to handle and process data efficiently within the system.

These technologies are integrated seamlessly to create a system that is both reliable and easy to use, offering a comprehensive solution for automated attendance tracking.

## Usage

The face recognition system comprises two main components: generating face encodings and running the attendance tracking system. Follow these instructions to use the system:

### Generate Face Encodings

Before using the attendance system, you need to generate face encodings for all student images located in the `images` directory. The face encoding generation process involves analyzing each student's image to extract unique facial features, which are then stored in a file for later use.

Run the encoding generation script to create the `EncodeFile.p`:

```bash
python generate_encodings.py
```

This script processes each image in the `images` directory, extracts face encodings, and saves the encodings along with corresponding student IDs to a file named `EncodeFile.p`. This file acts as a reference for identifying students during the attendance process.

### Run the Attendance System

Launch the main script to start the face recognition attendance system:

```bash
python main.py
```

The system will initialize the webcam and begin capturing video frames. As faces are detected, they are compared against the known encodings. When a match is identified, the student's attendance record is updated in the Firebase Realtime Database. The user interface displays relevant information, including the student's name, major, and current attendance status.

## Code Explanation

The project consists of two main scripts: `main.py` and `generate_encodings.py`. Each script plays a crucial role in the operation of the face recognition system.

### Main Attendance Script

The `main.py` script is responsible for the real-time operation of the attendance system. It encompasses the following key functions:

- **Firebase Initialization**: Establishes a connection to Firebase services using the service account key, enabling seamless interaction with the Realtime Database and Cloud Storage.

- **Camera Setup**: Configures the webcam to capture video frames with a specified resolution, providing the input data required for face recognition.

- **Background and Modes**: Loads a static background image and multiple mode images, which are displayed on the user interface to convey system status and feedback.

- **Face Recognition**: Continuously captures video frames, detects faces within each frame, and computes facial encodings. Detected faces are matched against pre-computed encodings, and when a match is found, the student's attendance is recorded.

- **UI Update**: Dynamically updates the user interface to display student information, attendance status, and feedback messages. Different modes are used to indicate various states, such as loading, recognition success, and errors.

### Encoding Generation Script

The `generate_encodings.py` script is responsible for preprocessing student images and generating face encodings. It performs the following steps:

- **Image Loading**: Reads student images from the `images` directory, ensuring that each image corresponds to a unique student ID.

- **Encoding Generation**: Converts images to RGB format and computes face encodings for each image using the `face_recognition` library. These encodings represent unique facial features used for identification.

- **File Saving**: Saves the list of encodings and student IDs to `EncodeFile.p`, allowing the main script to access and utilize these encodings for face matching during the attendance process.

## Firebase Configuration

To ensure the smooth operation of the face recognition system, it is essential to configure Firebase correctly. Follow these guidelines for Firebase setup:

1. **Firebase Project Setup**: Create a new Firebase project and enable the Realtime Database and Cloud Storage services.

2. **Service Account Key**: Obtain a service account key from the Firebase console and save it as `serviceAccountKey.json` in the project root directory. This key grants the application access to Firebase services.

3. **Database Structure**: Configure the Firebase Realtime Database with a `Students` node, where each child node represents a student's record. Each student record should include fields such as name, major, standing, year, total attendance, and last attendance time.

4. **Cloud Storage**: Store student images in Firebase Cloud Storage, organizing them by student ID. The system retrieves images from storage for display during the attendance process.

## Dependencies

This project relies on several key Python libraries, each serving a specific purpose:

- **OpenCV**: Provides tools for image and video processing, enabling the capture and manipulation of video frames.

- **face_recognition**: Facilitates facial recognition and manipulation, allowing the system to detect and identify faces based on pre-computed encodings.

- **cvzone**: Enhances the user interface by simplifying the creation of complex image overlays and graphical elements.

- **firebase-admin**: Enables seamless integration with Firebase services, allowing the system to interact with the Realtime Database and Cloud Storage.

- **NumPy**: Supports numerical operations and array manipulation, ensuring efficient data processing within the system.

Ensure these dependencies are installed on your system by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
